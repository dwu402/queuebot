## Deprecation Notice

Please note that discord.py, which this tool is built upon, has stopped being maintained. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1).
Furthermore, the former maintainer of that library has stated that Discord is beginning the process of deprecating bots, and its API entirely.
With this news, it is likely that this tool will cease to be functional whenever the next breaking change is made to the Discord API.

This bot is adapted from [`stroupbslayen`'s `queue-bot`](https://github.com/stroupbslayen/Other-Discord-Bots-async/tree/master/queue-bot).
